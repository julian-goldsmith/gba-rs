This repository contains code to draw sprites and backgrounds on the GameBoy Advance.  It was written by Julian Goldsmith around November 2017, and updated a few times in 2018.

It uses Xargo, which is deprecated; because of that, getting it to build may take some work.

I am unable to distribute the tiles I was using, so those are not included.

gba_crt0.s and gba_cart.ld are from devKitARM.
